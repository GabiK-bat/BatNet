###README BatNet
*BatNet* is an open-source, deep learning-based tool for rapid and accurate bat species identification from camera trap images, as described in Krivek et al., 202X. 
The baseline model is trained to identify the following 13 bat species or species complexes: *Barbastella barbastellus, Eptesicus serotinus, Myotis bechsteinii, 
Myotis dasycneme, Myotis daubentonii, Myotis emarginatus, Myotis myotis/M. blythii, Myotis brandtii/M. alcathoe/M. mystacinus, Myotis nattereri, Nyctalus noctula, 
Pipistrellus pipistrellus/P. pygmaeus, Plecotus auritus/P. austriacus, Rhinolophus hipposideros/R. ferrumequinum.*

##Running *BatNet* with a graphical user interface 
The user-friendly graphical interface allows us to combine the automated species identification pipeline with manual review of low-confidence predictions by human experts.
**Step 1. Opening *BatNet*:** open the unzipped folder and double-click on the `main.bat` file within the *BatNet* folder and this will open the graphical user interface
in your default web browser and a Command prompt window in the background.
